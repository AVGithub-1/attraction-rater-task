# attraction-rater-task
This project is the code for the experimental task of Xiaofan Shi's Honor's project. This task gives a set of images of women, and participants must rate how attractive each one is. Each image is from a set of 3 women, and each image either has one individual woman, 3 women but 2 are blurred out, or 3 women but you're supposed to only rate one. Participants will be shown the image briefly, then be asked to rate the attractiveness of one of the women in the image.

To run the task:
1. Open settings.py, and change any settings for the task that you want to change
2. run testpsychopy.py to start the task
